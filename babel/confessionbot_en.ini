[ownerintro]
message = Hey, I've just been added to {server}! In order for my features to work, you need to go to a channel for confessions and type `/set`.

[help]
introduction = - **Use `/confess` in a channel that's been set.** *Use `/list` to see all channels that are set.*
	- Admins can `/set` channels, assign `/botmod`s, and enable or disable `/imagesupport`.
	- Mods can `/shuffle` anon-ids, vet messages, and `/block` users from sending messages.
	- Use `/help (command)` for help with a specific command.
	
	**Still have questions?**
	Get dedicated support from the developer and other users on the [support server]({serverinv}).
bot_description = {c:main/botname} is the most advanced anonymous messaging bot on Discord, with mod tools, multiple anonymous channels types, image support, and much more!
	To start, `/set` an anonymous channel.
about_field1_title = 👷‍♂️ Moderation tools
about_field1_value = With the power of anonymous IDs generated for each user (when using a traceable confessions channel), moderators can block anon-IDs when nessecary, or shuffle anon-IDs if someone is at risk of being found out.
about_field2_title = 💬 Anonymous channel types
about_field2_value = Admins can create anonymous channels that are completely untraceable, traceable (for mod tools), vetted (require vetting before being posted publicly), or feedback (can be used without member read permissions).
about_field3_title = 🖼 Image support
about_field3_value = Images are automatically sent through with confessions by default, which is surprisingly uncommon of a feature in confession bots. *Note, though, that there is an NSFW filter forced on by Discord and it can't be disabled*
about_field4_title = 🌍 Translation support
about_field4_value = {c:main/botname} can be easily translated with the help of the community to other languages, check `{p:local}language` to see existing translations.
about_field5_title = 💵 Even more features with premium
about_field5_value = Support development and hosting costs while also getting some nice perks by going premium. Learn more about premium perks by using `{p:local}premium`.

[confessions]
command_confess_help = /confess [message] [image]
	Write an anonymous message to send in this channel. Only works if the channel is set. `/confess` without any options set will open a paragraph editor.
	Only images are supported. Videos (and any other files) will not send.
command_confess-to_help = /confess-to (channel) [message] [image]
	Write an anonymous message to send in any channel on this server. Autocomplete will list all channels that you can use.
	Refer to `/help confess` for how to write a confession.
command_set_help = /set (none|traceable|untraceable|vetting|feedback)
	Sets a channel for anonymous messages. You need to set the channel type (eg `/set traceable`) to one of the following;
	- `none`: Don't use this channel.
	- `traceable`: Show anon-ids for each message in this channel. Anon-ids make conversations easier to read and enables mods to ban users from confessing.
	- `untraceable`: Hide anon-ids in this channel. This makes it much more difficult to tell people apart.
	- `vetting`: Anonymous messages are sent to this mod channel where they can be approved before being posted publicly. Reveals anon-ids before they go to an untraceable channel.
	- `feedback`: Feedback channels can be posted to even if the user can't see the destination channel. Good for anonymous feedback or reports.
command_list_help = /list
	Lists all currently available anonymous channels on this server.
command_block_help = /block (anon-id) [unblock]
	Block any anon-id from sending anonymous messages. Blocks last until the next time you shuffle ids.
	Unblock by setting unblock to false; `/block abc123 true`
command_shuffle_help = /shuffle
	Resets all anon-ids to reduce the chances of one user being tracked and identified.
command_imagesupport_help = /imagesupport [enable|disable]
	Allow images to be sent in anonymous messages (NSFW images are blocked by Discord). Enabled by default. Disable with `/imagesupport disable`
command_botmod_help = /botmod (user) [revoke]
	Promote users in the server to allow them to shuffle anon-ids and vet messages without being a mod.
	Demote by setting revoke to true; `/botmod abc123 true`
